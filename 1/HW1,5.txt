Homework #1, Problem 5

Keypad (80H to 83H):
The addresses 80H to 83H correspond to each row of the keypad. The 80H is associated
with the top row, and 83H corresopnds to the bottom row. The first 4 bits 
don't change when the keys are pressed. However, the lower 4 bits change depending
on the different keys in each row. If the bit is 0, the button is unpressed; if the
bit is 1, the button is pressed. The lowest of the lower 4 bits is associated
with the leftmost button, and the highest of the lower 4 bits is associated with
the rightmost button.

Display (00H to 07H):
The addresses 00H to 07H each correspond to different digits on the display. When
a specific number is sent to one of the addresses, it will light up the digit
corresponding to the address. Assuming the number is an 8-bit binary, each bit
corresponds to a segment of the digit; 1 will light up the segment, and 0 will
not. The first bit is the top, second is top right, third is bottom right, fourth
is bottom, fifth is bottom left, sixth is top left, seventh is the middle line,
and eight is the dot in the bottom right.
