Homework #1, Problem 7

(A) No, the event handler is not being called. Setting a breakpoint at 
    TimerEvent2Handler and typing "go" also does not display a breakpoint on the
    command prompt, meaning that there is no event handler being called.

(B) Yes, the timer is running. If we continually type in the command "pcb" (after
    we run the program by typing in "go") we can notice that the Timer 2 Cnt 
    changed in value. This change in value tells us that Timer 2 is indeed running.
    
(C) Yes, they are generating interrupts. If we type in the command "pcb" (after
    we run the program by typing in "go"), we can notice that the Int Request is
    0001H and Int Status is 8004H, but the In Service is still 0000H. Hence, the 
    Timer2 is requesting an interrupt but the program is unable to call the event 
    handler.
    
(D) No, the processor is not responding to any interrupts. The Int Mask value is
    currently 00fdH, which means that every interrupt source has been masked, 
    or disabled. Hence, the processor is unable to process the interrupt request
    from Timer 2.
    
(E) The best way to fix this bug is to directly change the register value of 
    Int Mask. To do this, one can use the "wport" command and type in a value
    at Int Mask. A valid command would be "wport 0ff28H 00fcH", which effectively 
    changes the value of Int Mask to 00fcH. Since the Timer interrupt is now
    not masked, the processor can successfully call the event handler. In fact,
    if we set a breakpoint at Timer2EventHandler and type the command "go", we 
    will get an event handler message; hence, the event handler is being called.
    Once we clear all the breakpoints using the "clear all" message and click go,
    we can finally observe the phrase "U Got It" on the LED display.
