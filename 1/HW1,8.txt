Homework #1, Problem 8

We first start off by setting a breakpoint at IllegalEventHandler. Once we do so
and type in the command "go," the IllegalEventHandler is executed by the program.
If we type "next" for a while, we can see that "DIV CX" is the the instruction that 
caused the IllegalEventHandler at address 0040:0044. 

This event is executed because DX is not cleared when we DIV CX; if DX's value
is not properly cleared, it may cause an overflow and create issues, since the
remainder will try to be stored in DX. Hence, adding the line "XOR DX, DX" will 
be a sufficient way to get rid of the error by clearing DX to 0000H.
